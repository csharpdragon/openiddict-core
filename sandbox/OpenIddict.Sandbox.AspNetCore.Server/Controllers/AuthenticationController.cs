        // Multiple strategies exist to handle OAuth 2.0/OpenID Connect callbacks, each with their pros and cons:
        //
        //   * Directly using the tokens to perform the necessary action(s) on behalf of the user, which is suitable
        //     for applications that don't need a long-term access to the user's resources or don't want to store
        //     access/refresh tokens in a database or in an authentication cookie (which has security implications).
        //     It is also suitable for applications that don't need to authenticate users but only need to perform
        //     action(s) on their behalf by making API calls using the access token returned by the remote server.
        //
        //   * Storing the external claims/tokens in a database (and optionally keeping the essential claims in an
        //     authentication cookie so that cookie size limits are not hit). For the applications that use ASP.NET
        //     Core Identity, the UserManager.SetAuthenticationTokenAsync() API can be used to store external tokens.
        //
        //     Note: in this case, it's recommended to use column encryption to protect the tokens in the database.
        //
        //   * Storing the external claims/tokens in an authentication cookie, which doesn't require having
        //     a user database but may be affected by the cookie size limits enforced by most browser vendors
        //     (e.g Safari for macOS and Safari for iOS/iPadOS enforce a per-domain 4KB limit for all cookies).
        //
        //     Note: this is the approach used here, but the external claims are first filtered to only persist
        //     a few claims like the user identifier. The same approach is used to store the access/refresh tokens.

        // Important: if the remote server doesn't support OpenID Connect and doesn't expose a userinfo endpoint,
        // result.Principal.Identity will represent an unauthenticated identity and won't contain any claim.
        //
        // Such identities cannot be used as-is to build an authentication cookie in ASP.NET Core (as the
        // antiforgery stack requires at least a name claim to bind CSRF cookies to the user's identity) but
        // the access/refresh tokens can be retrieved using result.Properties.GetTokens() to make API calls.

        //
        // By default, all claims extracted during the authorization dance are available. The claims collection stored
        // in the cookie can be filtered out or mapped to different names depending the claim name or its issuer.
